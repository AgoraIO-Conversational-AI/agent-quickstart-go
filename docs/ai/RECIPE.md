# Recipe Contract

This repo is a base recipe for a Go-backed Agora Conversational AI quickstart. It publishes the extension points that downstream recipes can customize while keeping the browser contract, secret boundary, and local verification flow stable.

## Recipe Role

- Role: `base` quickstart recipe.
- Target audience: developers bootstrapping a production-style Conversational AI app with a Go Gin backend and Next.js web client.
- Reuse model: clone, bind project, run, then customize backend agent behavior or browser UI.

## Recipe Scope

This base recipe provides a copyable split-process starter with:

- Go Gin token generation and managed agent lifecycle.
- Next.js browser UI with RTC audio, RTM events, transcript, metrics, and connection status.
- Rewrite-only `/api/*` browser facade that hides backend placement.
- Managed default STT, LLM, and TTS provider configuration.
- Contract and local smoke verification that do not require live Agora calls.

## Baseline Implementation Guidance

This repository is the Go-backed Agora quickstart baseline for this recipe. Agents should use this repo's source and progressive disclosure docs as the starting point, then customize.

Do not recreate Agora ConvoAI integration from memory. Provider schemas, SDK builder fields, token behavior, and RTM event details can drift. For a new baseline implementation, follow [L1/L2/from_scratch_bootstrap.md](L1/L2/from_scratch_bootstrap.md) while copying verified patterns from this repo.

## Extension Points

| ID | Surface | Files | Intended Changes |
| -- | ------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| `agent.prompt` | Agent identity and first utterance | `server/agent.go`, `server/.env.example` | Change `adaPrompt`, the fallback greeting, or document `AGENT_GREETING` defaults. |
| `agent.pipeline` | Managed provider chain and session behavior | `server/agent.go`, `docs/ai/L1/L2/managed_agent_config.md` | Tune Deepgram STT, OpenAI LLM, MiniMax TTS, VAD, RTM parameters, metrics, idle timeout, or session expiry. |
| `api.routes` | Backend and browser API contract | `server/main.go`, `client/next.config.ts`, `client/src/services/api.ts`, `client/scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts` | Add or change route handlers, rewrites, request bodies, response payloads, and contract checks together. |
| `ui.conversation` | Browser conversation experience | `client/src/components/`, `client/src/lib/conversation.ts`, `client/src/types/conversation.ts` | Customize pre-call UI, connection details, transcript rendering, metrics, visualizer, mic controls, or end-call behavior. |
| `verification.contracts` | Local confidence checks | `Makefile`, `package.json`, `client/scripts/`, `server/main_test.go`, `server/cmd/fake-server/main.go` | Extend checks when routes, request shapes, or local runtime assumptions change. |

## Invariants

| ID | Rule | Why It Matters |
| -- | ---- | -------------- |
| `api.browser-paths` | Browser code calls `/api/get_config`, `/api/startAgent`, and `/api/stopAgent`; it does not call `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` directly. | Keeps local and deployed browser code identical. |
| `routing.rewrite-only` | `client/next.config.ts` owns `/api/*` rewrites; `client/app/api/**/route.ts` must not be introduced unless the architecture intentionally changes. | Prevents route handlers from shadowing rewrites and splitting behavior. |
| `secrets.server-only` | `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` stays in the Go server environment and never in `client/` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables. | Protects token signing credentials. |
| `uid.concrete-rtm` | Backend-generated UIDs must be non-zero before RTM login or renewal. | RTM tokens are tied to a concrete login subject; `0` is not valid for RTM. |
| `token.renewal-two-uids` | Renewal keeps separate RTC and RTM token requests when their UIDs can differ. | Prevents RTM renewal with a token minted for the wrong UID. |
| `agent.managed-defaults` | Managed Deepgram STT, OpenAI LLM, and MiniMax TTS remain the default path unless a recipe explicitly adds BYOK provider configuration. | Keeps the quickstart runnable with Agora-managed provider setup. |

## Stable Contracts

| Contract | Shape |
| -------- | ----- |
| Setup | `make setup` prepares env template, Go deps, and pnpm workspace deps. |
| Local dev | `make dev` starts Gin on `localhost:8000` and Next on `localhost:3000` with `AGENT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000`. |
| Required env | Go server requires `AGORA_APP_ID` and `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`; optional `AGENT_GREETING` and `PORT`. |
| Rewrite env | Next requires `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` anywhere `/api/*` should resolve to the Go backend. |
| Config API | `GET /api/get_config?channel=&uid=` returns `{ code, msg, data: { app_id, token, uid, channel_name, agent_uid } }`. |
| Start API | `POST /api/startAgent` sends `{ channelName, rtcUid, userUid }` and returns `data.agent_id`. |
| Stop API | `POST /api/stopAgent` sends `{ agentId }`; the client skips the request when the id is empty. |
| Verification | `make verify` is web-focused; `make verify-local` adds local Go-backed checks; `make verify-backend` runs Go tests. |

## Internal / Subject to Change

- Component composition inside `client/src/components/` can change as long as `LandingPage` still owns bootstrap and `ConversationComponent` still owns active RTC/RTM orchestration.
- Exact UI copy, Tailwind classes, logos, layout components, and visualizer presentation are not stable recipe contracts.
- Managed provider model names and VAD numbers are recipe defaults, not permanent API guarantees; update docs and tests when changing them.
- `server/agent.go` may be split into more files later, but the Go server remains the owner of Agora SDK calls and secret-backed token generation.
- Verification internals under `client/scripts/` may change, but route contracts and Make target names should remain stable for downstream recipes.
